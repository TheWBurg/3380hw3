Changed SSN to User-Name on the front end. SSN in the database signifies User name for all intents and purposes.

functional dependencies:
BCNF violations
airport table
-airport_name->airport_code

aircraft table
full_name->model

waitlist table
position->waitlist_id

Removing these BCNF violations would have been counterproductive. 
In the case of airport_name->airport_code and full_name->model, these
dependencies merely add information that makes the database easier to use.
The dependency between position and waitlist_id keeps the database from having
to update every position when someone is taken off the waitlist.

query.sql and transaction.sql files write all queries that are sent to the 
database. If the files are deleted they are created again by the program when
the next query is written.
